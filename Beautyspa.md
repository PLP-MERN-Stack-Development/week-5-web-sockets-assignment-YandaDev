Build me modern website/landing page for a beauty spa called Zonke's Boutique using JavaScript, React-Vite, Tailwind CSS and ShadCN.  This website allows clients and potential clients to book a session, 

A beauty spa website should offer the following key features to provide a great client experience and support business operations:

- **Online Booking System:** Allow clients to easily book, reschedule, or cancel appointments through a user-friendly interface with clear “Book Now” buttons and calendar selection. Automated confirmations and reminders (via email/SMS) help reduce no-shows.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design:** Since most users access websites via mobile devices, the site must be fully responsive, ensuring smooth navigation and usability on smartphones and tablet.
- **Client Account Management:** Enable clients to create and access personal profiles where they can view appointments, booking history, and preferences
- **Testimonials and Reviews:** Showcase customer feedback and ratings to build trust and encourage bookings
- **Service Listings and Pricing:** Clearly list all spa services with descriptions and prices, helping clients make informed decisions
- **Contact Information and Location:** Easy access to phone numbers, email, business hours, and interactive maps to find the spa location
- **High-Quality Imagery and Visual Design:** Use appealing, professional photos of the spa, staff, and services to create a welcoming and trustworthy impression
- **Social Media Integration:** Links to social profiles to extend brand presence and enable easy sharing or following
- **Online Payment Options:** Secure payment gateway integration to allow clients to pay for bookings or products directly on the site
- **Promotions and Newsletters:** Sign-up forms for special offers, updates, and newsletters to engage and retain clients
- **Feedback Forms:** Allow clients to provide direct feedback or suggestions post-service, helping improve customer satisfaction

These features collectively improve client convenience, increase bookings, and build a strong online presence for the spa.

To create a beauty spa website with front-end features (booking, feedback, testimonials) and a **customer service chatbot connected through WhatsApp Business**, while using **n8n for back-end automation** primarily via WhatsApp Business, you can set up the system as follows:

## How It Would Work

## 1. Front-End Website

- Your website will offer typical user-facing features like booking, rescheduling, cancellation, feedback forms, testimonials, and promotions sign-up.
- These can be built with standard web technologies or AI-assisted front-end tools (e.g., Lovable AI) as you prefer.
- Booking data and user inputs will be sent from the front-end to your backend system.

## 2. WhatsApp Business Chatbot via n8n

- Use **n8n’s WhatsApp Business Cloud node** to automate conversations on WhatsApp Business.
- The chatbot interacts with customers for booking confirmations, answering FAQs, or gathering feedback—all over WhatsApp.
- You can configure **“Send and Wait for Response”** workflows where the chatbot sends messages and waits for user replies, using **approval buttons, free text input, or custom forms** inside WhatsApp to collect info seamlessly
- This gives a conversational UI that clients use without leaving WhatsApp.

## 3. Backend Workflow Automation in n8n

- n8n acts as the automation engine:
    - Receives messages and data from WhatsApp Business.
    - Processes bookings, cancellations, or customer feedback.
    - Stores user info such as contact details and preferences in your preferred database (e.g., CRM, spreadsheet, or cloud storage).
    - Trigger workflows for promotional outreach based on collected data.
- n8n’s visual workflow builder lets you design these automations with no or low code.

## 4. Data Collection & Promotions

- Customer info gathered through chatbot conversations or website forms is pushed into your storage system.
- When you want to do promotions, n8n workflows can send bulk WhatsApp messages or personalized campaigns to these contacts directly via WhatsApp Business Cloud API.

## Steps to Set Up

1. **Set up your WhatsApp Business Cloud account:**
    - Create a Meta (Facebook) business portfolio and WhatsApp Business app.
    - Retrieve your app ID, client secret, and generate an access token & business account ID35.
2. **Connect WhatsApp Business Cloud to n8n:**
    - In n8n, create credentials using your WhatsApp client ID, secret, access token, and business ID.
    - Add a WhatsApp Business Cloud node to send/receive messages
3. **Build chatbot workflows in n8n:**
    - Use "Send and Wait for Response" node to engage clients interactively.
    - Design forms or approval prompts inside WhatsApp for booking and feedback.
    - Automate data storage and follow-ups.
4. **Integrate your front-end with n8n workflows:**
    - Website booking forms can trigger HTTP webhook workflows in n8n.
    - n8n processes these requests, updates your database, and optionally sends WhatsApp confirmation messages.
5. **Run promotional campaigns:**
    - Use stored client data to automate WhatsApp broadcast messages for promotions or announcements via n8n's WhatsApp nodes.

## Summary

- Your **front-end handles client UI (booking, feedback, info collection)**.
- **WhatsApp chatbot powered by n8n and WhatsApp Business Cloud** automates conversations and data collection.
- **n8n workflows automate processing, data storage, and promotional messaging**.
- This creates a seamless omnichannel experience combining website UI and WhatsApp engagement, all driven by no-code/low-code automation with n8n.
